What is this?
=============

This is a simple repository that is used to learn the ways of the github. There
are super sweet things that can be done and many of them are relatively
unknown. So this repository is just a place to play around and try different
things like creating pull requests, issues, and other github craziness.

## How do I contribute?

Well you don't really, it's just a place for me to contribute. I suppose you
can fork this repository and learn on your own, but it's also recommended that
you take a look at the [help](http://help.github.com) section. This gives many
ideas about what to try next.

This has been nothing more than a test. Go play, and have fun!
